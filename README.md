This is a game we are making for our WebApps project.

Any image assets (PNGs - including all sprites and tiles, etc.) go in the images folder.

Any audio (OGG or MP3) goes in the audio folder.

Any other assets (such as JSONs for players, powerups, the flag, the levels, etc.) go in the data folder.
